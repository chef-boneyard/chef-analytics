chef-analytics Cookbook
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef-analytics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef-analytics)

This cookbook configures a system to be a standalone Chef Analytics Server. It
will install the appropriate platform-specific opscode-analytics Omnibus
package from Package Cloud and perform the initial configuration.


Requirements
------------
This cookbook is tested with  Chef (client) 12. It may work with or
without modification on earlier versions of Chef, but Chef 12 is
recommended.

This cookbook will also not properly install analytics unless you have copied
actions-source.json into /etc/opscode-analytics from your chef-server.

## Cookbooks

* chef-ingredient cookbook

## Platform

This cookbook is tested on the following platforms using the
[Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) `.kitchen.yml` in the repository.
